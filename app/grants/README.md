# Gitcoin Grants

## What are Gitcoin grants?

Gitcoin Grants allows developers like you to get recurring cashflow for working on projects youâ€™re most excited about.

You can also support exciting projects that you love.

During matching grants rounds [Quadratic Funding](https://wtfisqf.com/?grant=&grant=&grant=&grant=&match=1000) is used to increase the impact of every donation. More info on grants can be found [here](https://gitcoin.co/grants/quickstart).
